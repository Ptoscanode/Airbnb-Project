# Data Science Project - Airbnb

## Project Motivation

Airbnb operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities, being based in San Francisco, California. As part of my Udacity's Data Science Nanodegree, I am going to explore the data and answer the following business questions:

- What is the most visited borough?
- What is the most frequent room type?
- What is the most popular room type by borough?
- On average, what is the most expensive borough?
- On average, what is the most expensive room type?
- What is the minimum, maximum and average price spend by borough and room type?
- What is the mean minimum nights distribution by borough? 
- What is the mean minimum nights distribution by room type?
- What is the minimum, maximum and average number of nights people spend by borough and room type?

To answer these questions, charts likes the ones below will be created through the use of functions
